# ## Memory Analyzer
# 
# When you run this notebook, the [Memory Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-model-memory-analyzer) will show you memory/storage statistics about the objects in your semantic model (i.e. Tables, Columns, Hierarchies, Partitions, and Relationships). These statistics may be used to identify areas of performance optimization and memory reduction for your semantic model.
# 
# ### Powering this feature: Semantic Link
# This notebook leverages [Semantic Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview), a python library which lets you optimize Fabric items for performance, memory and cost. The "[model_memory_analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric?view=semantic-link-python#sempy-fabric-model-memory-analyzer)" function used in this notebook is just one example of the useful [functions]((https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/semantic-link-sempy/sempy.fabric)) which Semantic Link offers.
# 
# You can find more [functions](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs#featured-scenarios) and [helper notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs/tree/main/notebooks) in [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs), a Python library that extends Semantic Link's capabilities to automate technical tasks.
# 
# ### Low-code solutions for data tasks
# You don't have to be a Python expert to use Semantic Link or Semantic Link Labs. Many functions can be used simply by entering your parameters and running the notebook.

# #### Learn more about notebooks in Fabric
# Notebooks in Fabric empower you to use code and low-code solutions for a wide range of data analytics and data engineering tasks such as data transformation, pipeline automation, and machine learning modeling.
# 
# * To edit this notebook, switch the mode from **Run** only to **Edit** or **Develop**.
# * You can safely delete this notebook after running it. This won’t affect your semantic model.
# * This notebook uses Python, which is currently a preview experience. For a General Availability experience, you can change the language to PySpark from the language dropdown menu in the Home tab.
